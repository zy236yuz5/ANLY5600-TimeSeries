The Gini coefficient, also called the Gini Index or Gini ratio, is a statistical measure of distribution intended to represent the income or wealth distribution of a nation. It ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%), with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality. A higher Gini coefficient means greater inequality. The Gini coefficient would be zero is everyone in a nation had the same income.   ----- https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/income-inequality-by-state
