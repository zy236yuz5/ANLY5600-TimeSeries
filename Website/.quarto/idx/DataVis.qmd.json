The goal is to gain insights and ideas before applying models and analysis. The data visualization and storytelling are very crucial for us to understand the impact of the income and houseing prices disparities. In this section, by utilizing different visualizations with different tools, we endeavor to delve into the depths of the datasets, finding potential trends, seasonality, and other features. \n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n## The Household Income, Saving, Sale Price\n\nFirst of all, we need to have a basic look at for the household income, household savings, and the sale price of the house. By putting the figures together, we can have a more direct idea about the trending and oscciliation throughout the time. Through interactive tableau visualization, we can see the temporal trends and oscillations that may be important for our analysis. \n\n<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1696104624114' style='position: relative'><noscript>\n<a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Da&#47;DataVis_16961040487410&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='DataVis_16961040487410&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Da&#47;DataVis_16961040487410&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object>\n\n</div>                \n\n\n<script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1696104624114');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='500px';vizElement.style.height='1000px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 700 ) { vizElement.style.width='500px';vizElement.style.height='1000px';} else { vizElement.style.width='50%';vizElement.style.height='800px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                \n</script>\n\n\nBased on the above plots, we can see that the household savings throughout the years generally follow an upwarding trend, which means that more and more people are willingly to save moneny. For Median household income, however, we can see that from 1984 to 2021, it has a lot of osccilations. Bascilly, the median household income did not change too much. And then! for sale prices of the houses, we can see that it follows a positive trend as well.\n\nFrom here, we can have a basic insight: while sale price increases, the median household income still remains the same throughout the years. This give us questions, why? And if this is the case, can people nowadays afford the house? In order to answer these quetsions, we need to dive into other datasets as well.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n\n## **Gross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator**\n\nFirst, we need to have a look at of the GDP as a whole. Since GDP represent economic evaluations, which can offer us invaluable insights into the financial health and trajectory of a nation. With the GDP Implicit Price Deflator data, we aim to have insights on the potential reason of the income and sale price of house. The Deflator helps to discern between changes in GDP due to alterations in prices and changes due to alterations in quantities. \n\n   <iframe src=\"./image/DataSource/gdp.html\" width=\"840\" height=\"600\"></iframe>\n\nBased on the interactive plotly plot, we can see the percent change from preceding period. Generally from 1960 to 1980, it follows an upwarding trend which aligns with the household savings and sale prices. Then from 1980 to 2020, it follows a downwarding trend and appears to have fluctuations from 2020 to now. From 2020, the Covid-19 surely had huge impact of the general economic. However, the decreasing of the percent change from 1980 to 2020 indicates that the percent changes are generally small, which means that for these years the GDP remains roughly the same, which aligns with the incomes from previous figure.\n\nThis also shows that while the GDP did not change too much, the household median incomes did not change as well. However, the sale prices and savings keep increasing. In addition, as we mentioned from introduction, the other important aspect that we want to explore is about the disparity. From the visulizations, although we see that the income keep increasing, there are still disparities in distribution of the income. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## The disparity of income based on GINI Index \nTo have a brief recap, Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income or consumption expenditure among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.\n\nAs we all aware, the disparity between geographic area exists. The Urban areas, especially metropolitan regions, are often have more economic. In this section, we want to find the extents of disparities and correlations between the income and other factors. From exploring the Gini coefficient, we can gain insights with income disparities, housing affordability as well as the trend and seasonality. \n\n  <iframe src=\"./image/DataViz/gini.html\" width=\"840\" height=\"600\"></iframe>\n\nBased on the GINI index over time, we can see that it follows an upwarding trend. Which is not a good thing, this means that we are towarding more inequality throughout the time. This means that the distribution of income within an economy deviates is not equal. We can see that from 1975 to 2019, the GINI index has increased about 8. However, from 2020, it seems that we have a decline of the GINI idex. Again, the Covid also had impacts of the generaly distribution of the incomes.\n\nFrom here, we can see that while the median income remains roughly the same, the distribution of the income did not remain constant. Which means that while many people gaining wealth, there are still more and more proverties. This can also imply that for a part of the people, they have got more resources while the others have troubles with housing affordability. To be more specific, we need to have a look at about the relationship between personal saving rate and the house price.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## The relationship between personal saving rate and the sale price\n\n In this section, we have a focused on understanding how personal savings rates interface with average sales prices of houses in the USA. From here, we aim to identify the trend and pattern such that we can see the direct impact of the relationship between saving rate and the sale price. We can understand how changes in saving rates might reflect or impact shifts in housing market trends.\n\n\n<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1696108002030' style='position: relative'><noscript>\n<a href='#'><img alt='Average Personal Saving Rate In USA VS Average Sales Price of Houses  ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Da&#47;DataVis_2_16961079929310&#47;Sheet6&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='DataVis_2_16961079929310&#47;Sheet6' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Da&#47;DataVis_2_16961079929310&#47;Sheet6&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object>\n</div>                \n\n<script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1696108002030');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>\n\nBased on the average personal saving rate and the average sales price of the houses, we can see that the personal saving rate fluctuates throughout the years while the average sales price follows an upwarding trend. The increasing of the house prices may be attributed to factors such as population growth, urbanization. However, as population grows, the saving rate did not change too much. Again, this could also means that the disparities in geographic locations play an important role.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n## The disparities among state and MSA regions. \n\nTaking a step further into our exploration, this section presents a bar visualization, providing a categorical breakdown of pivotal economic indicators and metrics. Our goal is to compare, contrast, and evaluate different states and MSA, identifying links and disparities among districts. \n\nNow, we wish to have a more specific look at about the disparities among regions. Here, we have selected some Meyropolitan Areas with states and MSAs. In here, we can see that which states or regions generally have a higher prices. Which can help us find the disparities.\n\n\n<iframe src=\"./image/DataViz/bar.html\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" style=\"width:100%; border:none;\"></iframe>\n\nBased on the linked figure, we can see that states for CA, CO, and HI generally have higher sale prices of houses. This means that the Geographic Disparities in Housing Markets did exist throughout the time. From 2018 to 2023, most of the places also have an upwarding trend in sale prices. This can make the housing affordability to change as well.\n\nIn addition, the real estate landscapes of CA, CO, and HI have been prospered among economists. The increasing in housing prices in these regions indicates several factors and disparities:\n\nHigh demand in states like CA and HI, may be the cause of increasing prices.\nIn addition, the economic landscapes of these states, often associated with sectors like advanced technology and high tourism that can boost the economy which makes the prices higher. However the average incomes did not change too much. This could bring affordability crisis in the future. \n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n# References and Codes\n- Codes: [Rmd, Python & Qmd](https://github.com/zy236yuz5/ANLY5600-TimeSeries)\n- U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Household saving [W398RC1A027NBEA], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/W398RC1A027NBEA, September 19, 2023.\n- U.S. Census Bureau, Real Median Household Income in the United States [MEHOINUSA672N], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N, September 19, 2023.\n- World Bank, GINI Index for the United States [SIPOVGINIUSA], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SIPOVGINIUSA, September 19, 2023.\n- U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Personal Saving Rate [PSAVERT], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT, September 19, 2023.\n- U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Gross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator [A191RI1Q225SBEA], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A191RI1Q225SBEA, September 18, 2023.\n- Zillow Group.
