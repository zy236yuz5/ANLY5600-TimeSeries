    "text": "Data Gathering\n\n\nData Discription & Source\nIn this section, different datasets are gained to help provide different analysis in later sections. Each dataset serves to answer questions that are defined in introduction section. To be more specifc, there are datasets regarding the household savings, incomes, sale prices, Gini idex, and housing affordability which can help us analysis the impact of the income disparities and housing affordability throughout USA. The detialed description of each dataset is provided.\n\n1. Household Savings\n\nLink: Household Saving Dataset\nDescription: This dataset contains information related to household savings in the United States throughout the years from 1992 to 2021. It includes data information on the saving, which can be an important economic indicator for me to make analysis. The Units for dataset are Billions of Dollars, Not Seasonally Adjusted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Real Median Household Income in the United States\n\nLink: Real Median Household Income Dataset\nDescription: This dataset represents the real median household income dataset. This is an estimation of Median Incomes. The Census Bureau has computed medians using either Pareto interpolation or linear interpolation. Currently, we are using linear interpolation to estimate all medians. Pareto interpolation assumes a decreasing density of population within an income interval, whereas linear interpolation assumes a constant density of population within an income interval. The Census Bureau calculated estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1979 through 1987 using Pareto interpolation if the estimate was larger than $20,000 for people or $40,000 for families and households. This is because the width of the income interval containing the estimate is greater than $2,500.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Median Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States\n\nLink: Median Sales Price of Houses Dataset\nDescription: This dataset contains information on the median sales price of houses sold in the United States. It can be a valuable indicator of the state of the real estate market.\nThis dataset can provide me with a direct view about the sale price of the house in USA. We can see clearly about the price disparities. Then, by comparing with the income and saving, we can know about the patterns regarding the impact of disparities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. GINI Index for the United States\n\nLink: GINI Index Dataset\nDescription: This dataset shows the Gini index for United States. Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income or consumption expenditure among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. In addition, a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.\nData are based on primary household survey data obtained from government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments.\nWorld Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available and includes national, regional, and global estimates. The World Bank labels these annual series, but several observations are missing..\n\n Source Indicator: SI.POV.GINI\n\n\n5. Housing Affordability Index\n\nLink: Housing Affordability Index Dataset\nDescription: This dataset contains data on the Housing Affordability Index. The housing affordability index measures the degree to which a typical family can afford the monthly mortgage payments on a typical home. Value of 100 means that a family with the median income has exactly enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. An index above 100 signifies that family earning the median income has more than enough income to qualify for a mortgage loan on a median-priced home, assuming a 20 percent down payment. This index is calculated for fixed mortgages.\nThis dataset can directly tell us if one can easily afford a house. This can help me make analysis the resources disparities and the possible reasons for the differences in housing affordability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Personal Saving Rate\n\nLink: Personal Saving Rate Dataset\nDescription: This dataset is to provide information on the personal saving rate. The personal saving rate measures the percentage of disposable income that individuals save, which can be indicative of financial health. In here, personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income (DPI), frequently referred to as “the personal saving rate,” is calculated as the ratio of personal saving to DPI.\nFrom this dataset, I can evaluate the overall changes throughout years regarding the personal savings. Then, by comparing with the income and house prices, we can see if there are any patterns or relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Gross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator\n\nLink: GDP: Implicit Price Deflator Dataset\nDescription: This dataset represents the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Implicit Price Deflator for USA, which is a measure of inflation in the economy and is used to adjust GDP for price changes.\nThis dataset aims to cover the overall GDP changes quetsions that can be utilized to make analysis on the impact of the incomes and housing prices.\n\n\n\n\n8. All Home Prices in States in the USA\n\nLink: Zillow Home Prices Dataset\nDescription: This dataset provides information on home prices in various states in the United States. It is sourced from Zillow, a well-known real estate and rental marketplace.\nThese housing datasets (from zillow group) not only provide sufficient information concerning the house values and sales prices, but also include the different regions. I wish to compare different states or regions to find if there are any patterns in house values, sales prices, and rental prices. I want to find correlations among them. In addition, some of the datasets cover a great range of time even from 2000 to 2023. This can provide with a broader view of the dataset when making visualizations across the time. We can see clearly how the housing values and sales prices changed throughout the years and make forecasts for the future.\n\nA Screen shot for the dataset: \n\n\n\nReference:\n\nCodes: Rmd, Python & Qmd\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Household saving [W398RC1A027NBEA], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/W398RC1A027NBEA, September 19, 2023.\nU.S. Census Bureau, Real Median Household Income in the United States [MEHOINUSA672N], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N, September 19, 2023.\nU.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Median Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States [MSPUS], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS, September 19, 2023.\nWorld Bank, GINI Index for the United States [SIPOVGINIUSA], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SIPOVGINIUSA, September 19, 2023.\nNational Association of Realtors, Housing Affordability Index (Fixed) [FIXHAI], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FIXHAI, September 19, 2023.\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Personal Saving Rate [PSAVERT], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT, September 19, 2023.\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Gross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator [A191RI1Q225SBEA], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A191RI1Q225SBEA, September 18, 2023.\nZillow Group.

    "text": "In this section, we will explore the datasets that we created by using visualizations. The goal is to gain insights and ideas before applying models and analysis. The data visualization and storytelling are very crucial for us to understand the impact of the income and houseing prices disparities. In this section, by utilizing different visualizations with different tools, we endeavor to delve into the depths of the datasets, finding potential trends, seasonality, and other features.\n\nThe Household Income, Saving, Sale Price\nFirst of all, we need to have a basic look at for the household income, household savings, and the sale price of the house. By putting the figures together, we can have a more direct idea about the trending and oscciliation throughout the time. Through interactive tableau visualization, we can see the temporal trends and oscillations that may be important for our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\nBased on the above plots, we can see that the household savings throughout the years generally follow an upwarding trend, which means that more and more people are willingly to save moneny. For Median household income, however, we can see that from 1984 to 2021, it has a lot of osccilations. Bascilly, the median household income did not change too much. And then! for sale prices of the houses, we can see that it follows a positive trend as well.\nFrom here, we can have a basic insight: while sale price increases, the median household income still remains the same throughout the years. This give us questions, why? And if this is the case, can people nowadays afford the house? In order to answer these quetsions, we need to dive into other datasets as well.\n\n\nGross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator\nFirst, we need to have a look at of the GDP as a whole. Since GDP represent economic evaluations, which can offer us invaluable insights into the financial health and trajectory of a nation. With the GDP Implicit Price Deflator data, we aim to have insights on the potential reason of the income and sale price of house. The Deflator helps to discern between changes in GDP due to alterations in prices and changes due to alterations in quantities.\n\nBased on the interactive plotly plot, we can see the percent change from preceding period. Generally from 1960 to 1980, it follows an upwarding trend which aligns with the household savings and sale prices. Then from 1980 to 2020, it follows a downwarding trend and appears to have fluctuations from 2020 to now. From 2020, the Covid-19 surely had huge impact of the general economic. However, the decreasing of the percent change from 1980 to 2020 indicates that the percent changes are generally small, which means that for these years the GDP remains roughly the same, which aligns with the incomes from previous figure.\nThis also shows that while the GDP did not change too much, the household median incomes did not change as well. However, the sale prices and savings keep increasing.\n\n\nFinding correlations and disparities among the top 20 metropoliatan areas across the time\n\n\n\nThe Pattern relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disparities among state and MSA\n\n\n\n\nReferences and Codes"

    "text": "The Impact of Income Disparities and Housing Affordability in the United States\n\nProject Backgroung:\nWith the dramatic development of the technology and society, we have witnessed the continuous increasing in economies. However, such developments did not spread through every corner in USA. The disparities of resources still exist. There are housing price disparities, rental sales disparities, and income disparities for different regions and states. These differents play a very crucial role in our society and they bring huge impact and massive pressure to people nowadays.\nThe central focus of this project lies in understanding the relationship between the income disparities between and housing affordability in the United States. I aim to help us understand and gain new insights on how varying income levels within society directly affect the ability of individuals and families to secure housing that is both suitable and affordable. Throughout the analysis, different smaller aspects and factors will be analyzed one by one. \n\n\nThe Big Picture & Literature Review:\nIncome disparity and housing affordability are not just matters of individual but also broader societal concerns that need to be attended to. The influences of such disparities and results are not only the quality of life for countless Americans citizens but also the overall stability of communities and the economic health of the nation. As I help us explore this issue, we must recognize that it’s not simply about monetary figures; it’s about the pursuit of a fundamental human need: shelter and how income inequality, housing price, rental price, GDP, personal saveing and regional difference influence us as a whole in the United States.\nIn order to bring a more comprehensive understanding of this topic, we must delve into the body of research and discourse that precedes us. Existing literature reveals the persistent challenge of housing affordability, marked by the growing gap between incomes and housing costs.(Jajtner et al., 2020). Scholars have examined the historical trends, policy interventions, and socioeconomic factors. In this exploration of the impact of income disparities on housing affordability, we will adopt multiple analytical angles to provide a well-rounded perspective.\n\nMutiple datasets are analyzed thoroughly to provide insights and conclusions. Different methods such as Exploratory Data Analysis, ARMA Models, ARIMAX Models, Spectral Analysis and Filtering,, Financial Time Series Models, and Deep Learning methods are conducted to help me achieve the goal.\n\n\nGuiding Questions that need to be answered:\nTo guide the explorations, we have conducted some questions that would be answered using different analysis and dataset:\n\nHow have income inequality trends in the United States impacted the individuals?\nWhat are the historical trends in housing prices?\nWhat is the definition of housing affordability, and what metrics are commonly used to assess it?\nHow do income disparities vary from one region to another?\nWhat regions or states have greater disparities?\nWhat impact have the economy had on the housing market?\nIs there any trends or seasonal patterns regarding the income and housing price?\nIn what ways does housing affordability intersect with broader economic and social issues, such as workforce mobility and education outcomes?\nWhat innovative solutions and strategies can be employed to improve housing affordability for all Americans?\nWhat are the correlations between the sale price, housing price, and rental price?\nWhat future trends should we anticipate in the context of income disparities and housing affordability?\nHow can addressing income disparities lead to a more equitable and sustainable housing market in the United States?\n\nThese guiding questions will serve as different milestones throughout this exploration. The questions might be changed and increased as the project proceeds."

(use the quantmod package to get stock prices from yahoo finance https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup/)\n\na.\nIn here, I utilize three different set of stock prices: GOOGL, MSFT - Microsoft Corporation, and NFLX - Netflix Inc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretations: The three stocks as showned in figure above represent:Google, MicroSoft, and Netflix. We can see that in general, Netflix had an overall highiest stock prices throughout the years. And Google has the least over the years. However, all three of them had fluctuations especially in year 2022, which could be the impact of the Covid-19.\n\n\nb. Plot the climate data (climate.csv) using plotly. https://plotly.com/r/\n\n\nInterpretations: By using the plotly on the climate dataset provided, we can see some interesting features. From above interaction figure, we can see the relation between the Date and the max temperature. We can see that during July and August in 2021, the max temperature is higher in general while lower during October and December which is reasonable.\n\n\nc. Get any economic data / macroeconomic indicators and plot using plotly https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ https://www.bea.gov/\nI utilized the GEPUCURRENT dataset, which is Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index: Current Price Adjusted GDP, from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GEPUCURRENT\n\n\nInterpretations: By using the plotly on the economic dataset from the website givem, I chose the GDP index of some global economic policy. From above interaction figure, we can see the relation between the Date and the index. We can see that the index follows an upwarding trend throughout the years. However, there are many local maximums and fluctuations throughout the years. In addition, the idex reached at its peak on 2020/05/01.\n\n\n\n2. Make only the plots visible in your webpage.

Any other pattern might suggest non-linearity or some pattern not captured by mere linear correlation\n\n\nCode\n#library(ggfortify)\n\n# Decomposition using ggplot2 styling\ndecomposed <- decompose(ts(df$PSAVERT, frequency=12), type = \"additive\")\nautoplot(decomposed) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E0E0E0\"),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E0E0E0\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(forecast)\n\n# ACF Plot\nggAcf(df$PSAVERT) +\n  labs(title = \"ACF of Housing Affordability Index Time Series\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E0E0E0\"),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E0E0E0\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# PACF Plot\nggPacf(df$PSAVERT) +\n  labs(title = \"PACF of Housing Affordability Index Time Series\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E0E0E0\"),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E0E0E0\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot can help determine if the series is stationary. If the series is non-stationary, the ACF will decay slowly, while for a stationary series, the ACF will drop off quickly\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tseries)\nadf.test(df$PSAVERT)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  df$PSAVERT\nDickey-Fuller = -3.543, Lag order = 9, p-value = 0.03817\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nstationary !\n\n\nCode\ndetrended_data <- data.frame(Date = df$DATE[-1], Detrended = diff(df$PSAVERT))\n\n# Enhanced Detrended Plot\nggplot(data = detrended_data, aes(x = Date, y = Detrended)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Detrended Time Series\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Detrended Value\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E0E0E0\"),\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"grey\", size = 0.1),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = \"grey\", size = 0.05),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E0E0E0\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlog_transformed_data <- data.frame(Date = df$DATE, LogTransformed = log(df$PSAVERT))\n\n# Enhanced Log-transformed Plot with Custom Background\nggplot(data = log_transformed_data, aes(x = Date, y = LogTransformed)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Log-transformed Time Series of Housing Affordability Index\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Log-transformed Value\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E0E0E0\"),\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"grey\", size = 0.1),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = \"grey\", size = 0.05),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#E0E0E0\"))"
